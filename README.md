# Infinity Weight
**Infinity Weight** is an application I made for tracking my weight during my weight loss journey.

# Technologies
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Sass**
- **JavaScript**
- **Vue.js**
- **Quasar**
- **Firebase**
- Hosted on **Netlify**

I chose **Quasar** because I wanted to use web technologies to create the app and use it on **mobile** and **desktop** as apps, and **Quasar** allows deployment on every major platform such as **web, android, ios, mac** and **desktop(electron)** from the same source code.

# Functionalities
Users have to create an account to have their data saved in the database.

The website has 3 main pages:
- **Home**, has 2 sections:
  - **History** displays all weights as a list where users can **add, delete, update** and **search** weights by date.
  - **Status** displays stats like **current weight** and the **weight lost** in the **last week, month, year** or **since the begining.**
- **Calendar**, here the user can also **add, update** and **delete** weights directly on the calendar, the weight and that day's change are also displayed under each respective date.
- **Chart**, here the user can see on a chart how they progressed in the **last week, month, 6 months, year to date**, or **since the beginning.**

When a weight is **added, updated** or **deleted**, the weight update difference between the other dates is also recalculated each time.
